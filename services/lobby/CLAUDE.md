# services/lobby/ — Go lobby server

Hosts the game-listing browser, brokers chat, tracks who's online,
and spawns dedicated `silencer -s` game servers when someone hits
"Create Game". Build/run/flags and the how-it-works narrative live in
[`README.md`](README.md); this file is for editing the code.

Stack: Go stdlib + `mongo-driver` (only when `MONGO_URL` set) +
`amqp091-go` (only when `AMQP_URL` set).

## Files

- `main.go` — flag parsing, wires `store → proc → hub`, TCP accept
  loop + UDP goroutine.
- `hub.go` — authoritative in-memory state (games, pending spawns,
  connected clients). **All mutations behind `h.mu`.** Fans out
  `NewGame` / `DelGame` to subscribers.
- `client.go` — one goroutine per TCP conn; dispatches opcodes to
  hub methods.
- `protocol.go` — wire format: `[len u8][payload]`, max 255 bytes.
  Reader/writer mirrors the client's `Serializer` (bit-aligned, but
  lobby fields happen to be byte-aligned).
- `proc.go` — spawns `silencer -s 127.0.0.1 <lobbyPort> <gameID>
  <accountID>` per `MSG_NEWGAME`; tracks PIDs; `StopAll()` on shutdown.
  The lobby host is hardcoded loopback because the dedicated server's
  heartbeat path uses `inet_addr()` (dotted-decimal only).
- `udp.go` — decodes heartbeat `[0x00][gameid u32][port u16][state u8]`
  → `hub.OnHeartbeat`.
- `store.go` — `lobby.json` atomic writes (temp + rename), SHA-1
  password hashes, per-agency stats keyed by user.
- `mongosync.go` — async-mirrors store mutations to MongoDB when
  `MONGO_URL` is set (see Storage). Password hashes never synced.
- `events.go` — fire-and-forget AMQP event publisher (`silencer.events`
  exchange) for the admin dashboard's live feed. Speaks AMQP 0.9.1 — works
  against LavinMQ (prod) and RabbitMQ (compose) interchangeably. No-op when
  `AMQP_URL`/`-amqp-url` unset.
- `playerauth.go` — internal HTTP server (`-player-auth-addr`, default
  `:15171`) the admin-api calls to validate player credentials. Not
  exposed outside the Docker network.
- `maps.go` — uploaded user maps: SHA-1-keyed storage on disk + JSON
  metadata. Filename whitelist + 64 KiB cap mirrors the engine's
  `world.cpp AllocateMapData` buffer.
- `update.go` — loads/serves the auto-update manifest (per-platform
  download URL + SHA-256) the client polls on launch.

## Invariants

- **Opcodes must match `clients/silencer/src/net/lobby.cpp`.** Adding
  one requires both sides and a client version bump.
- **Heartbeat timeout: 30 s** (`hub.go:30`). Miss → pending create
  fails with `status=2`.
- **`status=2` on `opNewGame` is reserved** for the client's "Could
  not create game" dialog (`clients/silencer/src/game/game.cpp:704`).
  Don't reuse.
- **Don't hold `h.mu` across network I/O.** Copy state under lock,
  send outside.

## Storage

`lobby.json` is source of truth — flat file, atomic writes
(temp + rename), SHA-1 password hashes. When `MONGO_URL` is set,
`mongosync.go` async-mirrors every mutation to MongoDB so the admin
dashboard sees up-to-date data. Password hashes are never synced.
Mongo is a mirror, not a backup — if it diverges, `lobby.json` wins.

## Gotchas

- **Port 517 needs root on macOS/Linux.** For local dev, run on
  `:15170` and rebuild the client with
  `-DSILENCER_LOBBY_PORT=15170` (see `clients/silencer/CLAUDE.md` gotchas).

## Docs

- [`README.md`](README.md) — build, run, flags, deployment, how-it-works.
- [`../../docs/production.md`](../../docs/production.md) — production
  deployment topology including the lobby's place in it.
